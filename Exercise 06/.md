# Overview

This SQL script is used to **insert 1000 student records** into a `students` table.  
It demonstrates how to **generate large amounts of test data automatically** using pure SQL, without writing hundreds of manual `INSERT` statements.

The inserted data includes:

- `name` → `Student_1`, `Student_2`, ..., `Student_1000`
- `email` → `student1@example.com`, `student2@example.com`, ..., `student1000@example.com`

This is useful for:

- Testing database queries
- Performance and indexing experiments
- Learning SQL `INSERT` and `SELECT` operations

## SQL Code

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, email)
SELECT
    CONCAT('Student_', n),
    CONCAT('student', n, '@example.com')
FROM (
    SELECT a.N + b.N * 10 + c.N * 100 + 1 AS n
    FROM
        (SELECT 0 N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4
         UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) a,
        (SELECT 0 N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4
         UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) b,
        (SELECT 0 N UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4
         UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) c
) numbers;
How It Works
Number Generation:
The subquery generates numbers 1 to 1000 by combining three sets of 0–9 (a, b, c) with the formula:

text
Copy code
n = a + b*10 + c*100 + 1
Name and Email Creation:
Each number n is converted to a student record:

text
Copy code
name  = Student_n
email = studentn@example.com
Insertion:
The INSERT INTO ... SELECT statement inserts all 1000 rows into the students table in a single query.

Benefits
Generates large test datasets quickly and efficiently

No need to manually type hundreds of INSERT statements

Useful for testing queries, performance, and indexes

Scales easily for thousands of records
